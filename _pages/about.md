I am a Principal Machine Learning Scientist -- Natural Language Processing in the Vision and Language Technologies (VALT) Group at Capital One Bank, where I joined in January 2019. Here, I am working on building and applying NLP models to improve and gain insights from customer service interactions.

Before that, I was a PostDoctoral Research Associate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) under [Dr. Svitlana Volkova](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~svitlana/). There I worked on evaluating the generalizability of state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER), machine comprehension (MC), and semantic role labeling (SRL) models across different datasets. I also worked on forecasting events in social-graphs like Reddit, Github, and Twitter by learning representations from previous days' knowledge graphs.

I graduated from the University of Houston with a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in Spring 2018. My advisor was [Dr. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/). My dissertation was on **Stylistically Aware Representations of Books**. I explored many novel [stylistic features](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-1114.pdf), [emotions flow across  books](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2042.pdf), [author embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1080.pdf), and [genre-aware attention model](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1375.pdf) for success prediction of books.
In addition, I also worked on various areas of NLP  including [Language Identification](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-5806.pdf) in codeswitched tweets, [Named Entity Recognition](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4419.pdf) in noisy social media data, [Detection of Cyberbullying](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3010.pdf), and [Author Profiling](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1180/CLEF2014wn-Pan-MaharjanEt2014.pdf).
