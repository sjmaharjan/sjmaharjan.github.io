    abstract = "Prompt-based learning methods in semi-supervised learning (SSL) settings have been shown to be effective on multiple natural language understanding (NLU) datasets and tasks in the literature. However, manually designing multiple prompts and verbalizers requires domain knowledge and human effort, making it difficult and expensive to scale across different datasets. In this paper, we propose two methods to automatically design multiple prompts and integrate automatic verbalizer in SSL settings without sacrificing performance. The first method uses various demonstration examples with learnable continuous prompt tokens to create diverse prompt models. The second method uses a varying number of soft prompt tokens to encourage language models to learn different prompts. For the verbalizer, we use the prototypical verbalizer to replace the manual one. In summary, we obtained the best average accuracy of 73.2% (a relative improvement of 2.52% over even the previous state-of-the-art SSL method with manual prompts and verbalizers) in different few-shot learning settings",

While many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis are mature and well designed for monolingual text, techniques to apply these tasks to code-mixed text still warrant exploration. This paper describes our feature engineering approach to sentiment analysis in code-mixed social media text for SemEval-2020 Task 9: SentiMix. We tackle this problem by leveraging a set of hand-engineered lexical, sentiment, and metadata fea- tures to design a classifier that can disambiguate between {``}positive{''}, {``}negative{''} and {``}neutral{''} sentiment. With this model we are able to obtain a weighted F1 score of 0.65 for the {``}Hinglish{''} task and 0.63 for the {``}Spanglish{''} tasks.",

    abstract = {The awareness about software vulnerabilities is crucial to ensure effective cybersecurity practices, the development of high-quality software, and, ultimately, national security. This awareness can be better understood by studying the spread, structure and evolution of software vulnerability discussions across online communities. This work is the first to evaluate and contrast how discussions about software vulnerabilities spread on three social platforms—Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit. Moreover, we measure how user-level e.g., bot or not, and content-level characteristics e.g., vulnerability severity, post subjectivity, targeted operating systems as well as social network topology influence the rate of vulnerability discussion spread. To lay the groundwork, we present a novel fundamental framework for measuring information spread in multiple social platforms that identifies spread mechanisms and observables, units of information, and groups of measurements. We then contrast topologies for three social networks and analyze the effect of the network structure on the way discussions about vulnerabilities spread. We measure the scale and speed of the discussion spread to understand how far and how wide they go, how many users participate, and the duration of their spread. To demonstrate the awareness of more impactful vulnerabilities, a subset of our analysis focuses on vulnerabilities targeted during recent major cyber-attacks and those exploited by advanced persistent threat groups. One of our major findings is that most discussions start on GitHub not only before Twitter and Reddit, but even before a vulnerability is officially published. The severity of a vulnerability contributes to how much it spreads, especially on Twitter. Highly severe vulnerabilities have significantly deeper, broader and more viral discussion threads. When analyzing vulnerabilities in software products we found that different flavors of Linux received the highest discussion volume. We also observe that Twitter discussions started by humans have larger size, breadth, depth, adoption rate, lifetime, and structural virality compared to those started by bots. On Reddit, discussion threads of positive posts are larger, wider, and deeper than negative or neutral posts. We also found that all three networks have high modularity that encourages spread. However, the spread on GitHub is different from other networks, because GitHub is more dense, has stronger community structure and assortativity that enhances information diffusion. We anticipate the results of our analysis to not only increase the understanding of software vulnerability awareness but also inform the existing and new analytical frameworks for simulating information spread e.g., disinformation across multiple social environments online.},

To address these limitations, we propose (1) a novel task – forecasting user interactions over dynamic social graphs, and (2) a novel deep learning, multi-task, node-aware at- tention model that focuses on forecasting social interactions, going beyond recently emerged approaches for learning dynamic graph embeddings. Our model relies on graph convolutions and recurrent layers to forecast future social behavior and interaction patterns in dynamic social graphs. We evaluate our model on the ability to forecast the number of retweets and mentions of a specific news source on Twitter (focusing on deceptive and credible news sources) with R2 of 0.79 for retweets and 0.81 for mentions. An additional evaluation includes model forecasts of user-repository interactions on GitHub and comments to a specific video on YouTube with a mean absolute error close to 2% and R2 exceeding 0.69. Our results demonstrate that learning from connectivity information over time in combination with node embeddings yields better forecasting results than when we incorporate the state-of-the-art graph em- beddings e.g., Node2Vec and DeepWalk into our model. Finally, we perform in-depth analyses to examine factors that influence model performance across tasks and different graph types e.g., the influence of training and forecasting windows as well as graph topological properties.},

Our system ranked first place for Arabic (MSA-Egyptian) with an F1-score of 0.83 and second place for Spanish-English with an F1-score of 0.90. The HHU-UHG system introduces a novel unified neural network architecture for language identification in code-switched tweets for both SpanishEnglish and MSA-Egyptian dialect. The system makes use of word and character level representations to identify code-switching. For the MSA-Egyptian dialect the system does not rely on any kind of language-specific knowledge or linguistic resources such as, Part Of Speech (POS) taggers, morphological analyzers, gazetteers or word lists to obtain state-ofthe-art performance.",

Despite its prevalence, limited effort has been devoted to develop computational approaches or even basic linguistic resources to support research into the processing of such mixed language data. We present a user-centric approach to collecting code-switched utterances from social media posts, and develop language universal guidelines for the annotation of codeswitched data. We also present results for several baseline language identification models on our corpora and demonstrate that language identification in code-switched text is a difficult task that calls for deeper investigation.",

  abstract="Classifying malware into correct families is an important task for anti-virus vendors. Currently, only some of them will recognize a particular malware. Even when they do, they either classify them into different families or use a generic family name, which does not provide much information. Our method for malware family identification is based on the observation that closely related malware have heavy overlap of strings. We first created two kinds of prototypes from printable strings in the malware: one using term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and the other using the prominent strings extracted from the vocabulary. We then used these prototypes for classification. We achieved an accuracy of 91.02 {\%} by considering the entire vocabulary and an accuracy of 80.52 {\%} by considering 20 prominent strings for each malware family. Our accuracy is high enough for our system to be used to classify even those malware that can confuse the anti-virus vendors.",

  abstract="Most natural language processing tasks deal with large amounts of data, which takes a lot of time to process. For better results, a larger dataset and a good set of features are very helpful. But larger volumes of text and high dimensionality of features will mean slower performance. Thus, natural language processing and distributed computing are a good match. In the PAN 2013 competition, the test runtimes for author profiling range from several minutes to several days. Most author profiling systems available now are either inaccurate or slow or both. Our system, written entirely in MapReduce, employs nearly 3 million features and still manages to finish the task in a fraction of time than state-of-the-art systems and with better accuracy. Our system demonstrates that when we deal with a huge amount of data and/or a large number of features, using distributed systems makes perfect sense.",

The shared task included code-switched data from four language pairs: Modern Standard Arabic-Dialectal Arabic (MSA-DA), Mandarin-English (MAN-EN), Nepali-English (NEP-EN), and Spanish-English (SPA-EN). A total of seven teams participated in the task and submitted 42 system runs. The evaluation showed that language identification at the token level is more difficult when the languages present are closely related, as in the case of MSA-DA, where the prediction performance was the lowest among all language pairs. In contrast, the language pairs with the higest F-measure where SPA-EN and NEP-EN. The task made evident that language identification in code-switched data is still far from solved and warrants further research.",

  abstract="Author profiling, being an important problem in forensics, security, marketing, and literary research, needs to be accurate. With massive amounts of online text readily available on which we might need to perform author profiling, building a fast system is as important as building an accurate system, but this can be challenging. However, the use of distributive computing techniques like MapReduce can significantly lower processing time by distributing tasks across multiple machines. Our system uses MapReduce programming paradigm for most parts of the training process, which makes our system fast. Our system uses word n-grams including stopwords, punctuations and emoticons as features and TF-IDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) as the weighing scheme. These are fed to the logistic regression classifier that predicts the age and gender of the authors. We were able to obtain a competitive accuracy in most categories and even obtained winning accuracy for two of the categories each in both test corpus 1 and test corpus 2.",

  abstract="As plagiarisers become cleverer, plagiarism detection becomes harder. Plagiarisers will find new ways to obfuscate the plagiarized passages so that humans and automatic plagiarism detectors are not able to point them out. So, a plagiarism detection system needs to be robust enough to detect plagiarism, no matter what obfuscation techniques have been applied. Our system attempts to do the same by combining two different methods, one stricter to catch mildly obfuscated passages and one more lenient to catch difficult ones. We use a machine translation evaluation metric and n-gram matching to detect overlaps between the source and suspicious documents. On the PAN’14 corpus, which contains data with various types of obfuscation to mimic human plagiarisers, we obtained plagdet scores of 0.84404 and 0.86806 on the two datasets.  ",

  abstract="Recommendation systems apply statistical and knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making product recommendations and they are achieving widespread success in E-Commerce these days. A successful recommendation system fulfils several purposes and the choice of the methodology significantly influences the quality of recommendations and other aspects including scalability. As the volume of data in the e-commerce is growing massively, the system should also be able to address the need to provide the recommendations either by in-memory calculations or offline calculations, both demanding the high performance. For a large number of customers and products, the linear regression with a proper model selection can provide significantly better results and performance. Recommendations engines are increasingly becoming a popular choice for solving the problem of content discovery enabling the user to find personally relevant content that they might not have known was available. In this paper, we consider linear regression technique for analyzing large-scale dataset for the purpose of useful recommendations to e-commerce customers by offline calculations of model results.",
